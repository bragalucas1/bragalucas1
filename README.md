## Hello there, I'm Lucas Braga!
Hello, there! I'm Lucas Braga, 23 years old, Computer Science Student in Federal University of Vi√ßosa - Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. I got a strong knowledge on complex C++, C#, Java and PHP codes, SQL and NoSQL Databases and JavaScript/TypeScript. Currently studying and improving skills on C#, Unit Test for each language, PHP, Java and NodeJS.

As Under Graduate Student, I have eyes wide open in Software Development's Fundamentals, such as Design Patterns and Architeture, Clean Code, Unit Tests, TDD, DDD and those implications. I try to adapt all my knowledge on college projects and at work tasks.

Currently, I'm working at dti digital as a mid-level Full Stack Developer, working mostly with .NET, and React, in a massive project, which deal with real time updates and huge data consumption, that can be described as an Intelligence Center to give assertive decisions to the clients, in a operational and cleverness way.

Also in my free time I am an amauter runner and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu intusiast. ü•ãüèÉüèª
